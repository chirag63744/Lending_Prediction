## Lending Prediction System

# Introduction
Distribution of the loans is the core business part of almost every banks. The main portion the bank’s
assets are directly coming from the profit earned from the loans distributed by the banks. The prime
objective in banking environment is to invest their assets in safe hands where it is. Today many
banks/financial companies approve loan after a regress process of verification and validation but still
there is no surety whether the chosen applicant is the deserving right applicant out of all applicants.
Through this system we can predict whether that particular applicant is safe or not and the whole
process of validation of features is automated by machine learning technique.

# Tool Used:
➢ NetBeans- For Java swing
➢ Google Collab- For Training Dataset with Suitable Machine learning algorithm
➢ PyCharm – To create an API and get input in json format
➢ MySQL – Database
➢ Microsoft Excel – For dataset

# Steps Involved
1. Collect dataset in csv format.
2. Train the dataset using Google collab
3. Create a pickle file
4. Run api in in PyCharm
5. Design the interface using java swing
